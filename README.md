# Dockerized Microservices Scenario: Practical Usage

This repository contains the code and configuration for a microservices scenario using Docker. It includes the following files:

- `banco.sql`: SQL script to create a database table.
- `dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the application container.
- `index.php`: PHP script for generating and inserting data.
- `nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration file.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Description

This repository demonstrates a practical usage scenario of Docker in a microservices environment. It allows you to create containers for different services and deploy them efficiently. The included files and configurations are designed to help you understand and implement microservices using Docker.

## Database Setup

The `banco.sql` script can be used to create the database table. Ensure that you have a MySQL database set up with the appropriate credentials.

## PHP Application

The `index.php` file is a PHP script that connects to a MySQL database and inserts random data into the table.

## Nginx Configuration

The `nginx.conf` file provides the Nginx configuration for the application.

## Docker

This scenario demonstrates the practical usage of Docker in a microservices environment. It allows you to create containers for different services and deploy them efficiently.

## Live Coding Session

For a detailed explanation and walkthrough of this scenario, watch the Live Coding session by Denilson Bonatti on the Digital Innovation One YouTube channel. This session covers the real purpose of containers in microservices, practical examples, and more.
